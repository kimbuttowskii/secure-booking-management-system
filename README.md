# Secure Booking Management System

A secure web-based Booking Management System developed using Laravel with a strong focus on secure coding practices, access control, and vulnerability mitigation.
This project was developed as part of an Application Security / Secure Web Development assignment.

## Project Overview

The Secure Booking Management System allows authenticated users to create, view, update, and delete service bookings securely.
An admin role is included to manage all bookings. The system applies OWASP Top 10 security controls and was tested using Snyk.

### Objectives:
- Implement a secure CRUD booking system
- Apply authentication & authorization controls
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities
- Log sensitive user actions
- Perform vulnerability scanning and remediation
